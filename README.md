# Numbering-System-Convertor
This Python program is a **Numbering System Converter** that allows users to convert numbers between **decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal** bases. It features a **menu-driven interface** where users first select the input number's base (e.g., decimal, binary), then choose the target base for conversion. The program includes **12 conversion functions**, such as `decimal_to_binary()`, `binary_to_hexadecimal()`, and `hexadecimal_to_octal()`, which use arithmetic operations (division/modulo) and digit mapping (for hex) to perform conversions. The main loop repeatedly prompts the user for input until they choose to exit. Designed for clarity, the code handles invalid inputs gracefully and efficiently bridges different numeral systems through intermediate decimal conversions when needed.
